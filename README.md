The purpose of the project was to build a search engine over a list of movies that have a dedicate page on Wikipedia.

The repository consists of the following files:
* `collector.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to collect data from the `html` pages 1,2,3 of Wikipedia.
* `collector_utils.py`: a python file that stores the function we used in `collector.py`.
* `parser.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to parse the entire collection of `html` pages and save those in `tsv` files.
* `parser_utils.py`: a python file that gathers the function we used in `parser.py`.
* `index.py`: a python file that once executed generate the indexes of the Search engines.
* `index_utils.py`: a python file that contains the functions we used for creating indexes.
* `main.py`: a python file that once executed build up the search engine. 
* `exercise_4.py`: python file that contains the implementation of the algorithm that solves problem 4.
* `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook that explains the strategies we adopted solving the homework.
